# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in skill-issue, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email **security@skill-issue.sh** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.
